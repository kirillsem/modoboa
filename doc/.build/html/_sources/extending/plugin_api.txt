Adding a new plugin
###################

************
Introduction
************

Modoboa offers a plugin API to expand its capabilities. The current
implementation provides the following possibilities:

* Expand navigation by adding entry points to your plugin inside the GUI
* Access and modify administrative objects (domains, mailboxes, etc.)
* Register callback actions for specific events

Plugins are nothing more than Django applications with an extra piece
of code that integrates them into Modoboa. Usually, the *__init__.py* file
will contain a complete description of the plugin:

* Admin and user parameters
* Observed events
* Custom menu entries

The communication between both applications is provided by
:ref:`events`. Modoboa offers some kind of hooks to let plugin add custom
actions.

The following subsections describe plugin architecture and explain
how you can create your own plugin.

*****************
The required glue
*****************

To create a new plugin, just start a new django application like
this (into modoboa's directory)::

  $ python manage.py startapp

Then, you need to register this application using the provided
API. Just copy/paste the following example into the *__init__.py* file
of the future extension::

  from modoboa.extensions import ModoExtension, exts_pool
  
  class MyExtension(ModoExtension):
      name = "myext"
      label = "My Extension"
      version = "0.1"
      description = "A description"
      url = "myext_root_location" # optional, name is used if not defined
      
      def init(self):
          """This method is called when the extension is activated.
          """
          pass
          
      def load(self):
          """This method is called when Modoboa loads available and activated plugins.

          Declare parameters and register events here.
          """ 
          pass
          
      def destroy(self):
          """This function is called when a plugin is disabled from the interface.
          
          Unregister parameters and events here.
          """
          pass

  exts_pool.register_extension(MyExtension)

Once done, simply add your plugin's module name to the
``INSTALLED_APPS`` variable located inside *settings.py*. Optionaly,
run ``python manage.py syncdb`` if your plugin provides custom tables
and ``python manage.py collectstatic`` to update static files.

**********
Parameters
**********

A plugin can declare its own parameters. There are two levels available:

* 'Administration' parameters : used to configure the plugin, editable
  inside the *Admin > Settings > Parameters* page,
* 'User' parameters : per-user parameters (or preferences), editable
  inside the *Options > Preferences* page.

Playing with parameters
=======================

To declare a new administration parameter, use the following function::

  from modoboa.lib import parameters

  parameters.register_admin(name, **kwargs)

To declare a new user parameter, use the following function::

  parameter.register_user(name, **kwargs)

Both functions accept extra arguments listed here:

* ``type`` : parameter's type, possible values are : ``int``, ``string``, ``list``, ``list_yesno``,
* ``deflt`` : default value,
* ``help`` : help text,
* ``values`` : list of possible values if ``type`` is ``list``.

To undeclare parameters (for example when a plugin is disabled is
disabled from the interface), use the following function::

  parameters.unregister_app(appname)

``appname`` corresponds to your plugin's name, ie. the name of the
directory containing the source code.

***************************
Custom administrative roles
***************************

Modoboa uses Django's internal permission system. Administrative roles
are nothing more than groups (``Group`` instances).

If an extension needs to add new roles, it needs to follow those steps:

#. Create a new ``Group`` instance. It can be done by providing
   `fixtures <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/initial-data/>`_ 
   or by creating it into the extension ``init`` function

#. A a new listener for the :ref:`getextraroles` event that will return
   the group's name
